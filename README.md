# image-to-ascii

This program transforms your picture into ASCII art. I'm using 10-level character sequence for representing 10 levels of grey: " .:-=+*#%@".

How to use it?
Just put an image name (it has to be in the same filepath as the rest of files) into the createAsciiPicture(image1,scale) function. Optionally, you can change the scale, on default it's set to 30 - that means that the image has 30 times less pixels.

Okay, but where can I see the output.
It's simple! It's in the file called "jpg".
